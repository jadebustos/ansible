# personal-vim

Based on Javier Roman's vim configuration https://github.com/javiroman/personal-vim

# known issues

* Hardcoded stuff like username and user's home directory
* Tested in Fedora (dnf needed)
* Need to be executed by root

# future versions

* Use variables instead of hardcoding
* Tune to be used with another Red Hat based distros and Debian distros
